# Webscraping_Yelp
 ## Webscraping Yelp and Analyze & Visualize the data
 
 ### What's in the repository
 1. Yelp_Webscraping.ipynb contains code to webscrape the each resutaurant's information and save them to a csv file.
 2. Yelp_Analysis.ipynb contains code to analyze and visualize the data that I collected in Yelp_Webscraping.ipynb.
 3. CSV file that contains all the information that I scraped.

### Summary & Insights on the data 
 1. Ratings are mostly between 3.5 to 4.0
 2. Price range is almost 1 or 2. So, those restaurants are relatively cheap.
 3. As we can see in the plot "Top 10 High number of food categories", most of the places are **Asian food** such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. We can assume that there are more Asian people living aroung this area.
 4. From the pie chart "Restaurant's area ratio", we can see that a lot of restaurant's are located in "Unionville".
 5. Seems like there is no correlation between Rating and Review count, Rating and Price Range.
 6. High review counts are focused on one specific restaurant.
